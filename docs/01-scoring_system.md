# Scoring system
The scoring system, attributes *role points* to every answer. Each hero has a defined set of *role score*.
Whichever hero comes closer to your overall *role points* after the questions are over will be recommended to you.

## Role points
There are some distinct role categories, those are:

### Gunner
The importance of the M1 on the character's playstyle.
### Mystic
The proeminence of abilities in the heroe's damage output.
### Disabler
The ammount of CC effects the character has at their disposal.
### Mobile
The ability a hero has of manuvering around.
### Support
Effects that can target and aid a teammate.
### Durable
How resistant to assault the hero can be.
### Initiator
How well can the hero create opportunities.
### Opportunist
How well a hero can capitalize on found or created opportunities.

## Role score
Each hero has a set score of role points in each category ranging from -5 to 5.
Where 0 represents neutrality in that category. Negative numbers represent penality.
Positive numbers represent affinity to that category.

### How are role scores defined?

They are based on the specific hero skill sets and attributes currently.
It does not take in account the current meta and item builds.
The idea is that the player can find the hero who he is going to get the most fun playing as.
The "optimal way" to play the hero will be disconsidered. That's part of the experience in competitive games for players to find that out on their own.
