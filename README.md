# A community website for finding out who is could be the perfect Main pick for you.

A quick solution for people who are interested in playing Deadlock, but don't want to blindly try every hero to find out
who best fits their playstyle.

## Answer questions

You will have to answer questions regarding your gaming playstyle overall.
Won't matter if you played Mobas or Hero shooters before.

## The webapp will find the hero that comes the closest to the profile given by your answers.

You should then hop into the game and try that hero out. If he isn't quite right, just come back here and retake the test.
Having played the game will give you more perspective on your actual style.
Slightly changing your answers will probably give you a different result.
