So when Apollo was told that it was for his own safety he was being sent to New York for school, he knew the situation was serious.", "Adjusting to life at Blackmore Academy didn’t come easy to Apollo. His school was supposed to be filled with The Cursed Apple’s best and brightest but all he saw, with few exceptions, was a sea of aggressive mediocrity. Electing not to waste his time with frivolous things like parties and dances, he instead put his energy on the piste, where he rigorously trains as captain of the Blackmore fencing team.", "However, at the end of the day Apollo does not fret too much on the tedium of life in New York. He knows that eventually the time will come when his father will call on him to come home and he will get to show that he is worthy of wielding his family's ancestral blade."],
